          <h2> What It Is </h2>
          <p>
            This is a voting application for Hack Club Orpheus art. In the end, there should be a ranking of Orpheus art pieces based on the sets received. There are about a thousand images, so it is a community effort!
          </p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h2> How It Works </h2>
          <p>
            Decide which ones are the coolest through a continous voting process which involves ordering 4 random images against each other. The database will then collect the images and then decide how to rank them using all the orders received. The more you vote, the more accurate the ranking will be! The leaderboard is freely viewable, and if voting takes too long, you can always admire the top rankings.
          </p>

          <h2> Show Your Appreciation </h2>
          <p>
            If you liked it, please get others to help vote! It would improve the accuracy and quality of the ranking.

          <h2> Contact and Creation </h2>
          <p>
            This project has been made for a YSWS (You Ship, We Ship) called <a href="https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/">Shipwrecked</a> by <i>Hack Club</i>. Before joining the YSWS, I was interested in art of the mascot of Hack Club, <i>Orpheus</i>. It was hard to find the best art, as they were randomly ordered. This project was created to solve that by allowing users to decide which ones are the best.
